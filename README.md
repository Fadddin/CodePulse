## MEDICODE is a mern app made as a part for NITS HACKS Hackathon 2024

MEDICODE is an innovative MERN application that integrates GPT
(Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models and TensorFlow. With
MEDICODE, users can upload their prescriptions, and the app utilizes
OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology and AI to extract the
names of prescribed medicines. This information is then used to
provide users with detailed information about their medications.
The primary goal of MEDICODE is to enhance health literacy and
empower users by offering a user-friendly platform to better
understand their prescriptions. By providing detailed information about
prescribed medications, MEDICODE ensures that users have the
knowledge they need to manage their health effectively.
